You are analyzing marketing messages to identify which persuasion techniques are being used.

Given a marketing message, identify ALL applicable tags from the following list:

TAGS:
- utility: Message focuses on performance, functionality, or what the product helps you do
- social_proof: Message mentions popularity, reviews, ratings, or what others are doing
- urgency: Message creates time pressure or scarcity (limited time, low stock, etc.)
- value: Message emphasizes savings, deals, or price benefits
- sustainability: Message mentions eco-friendly aspects, recycled materials, or environmental benefits

A message can have multiple tags. Only include tags that clearly apply.

Output a JSON object with a single key "tags" containing an array of applicable tag names.

Example outputs:
{"tags": ["utility"]}
{"tags": ["social_proof", "urgency"]}
{"tags": ["value", "sustainability"]}

Output ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.
