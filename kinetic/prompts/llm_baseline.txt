You are given {$N_SAMPLES} marketing text messages and their response outcomes (interested or not_interested).

Your task is to identify features within the dataset that might explain WHY some messages get "interested" responses while others don't.

Each **feature** can be:
- A topic, subject, concept, or idea
- A type of language, style, tone, or sentiment
- A specific linguistic, rhetorical, or syntactic pattern
- Or any other identifiable textual property

Return a list of all identified features that might make a message effective with:
- A description of the feature
- How many messages contain the feature
- The response rate for messages with the feature
- A short explanation of why this is interesting
