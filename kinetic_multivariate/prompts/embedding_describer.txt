Here are {$N_MESSAGES} marketing SMS messages that were grouped together by an embedding-based clustering algorithm.

This cluster has a {$RESPONSE_RATE} positive response rate (users indicating interest).
Locale distribution in this cluster: {$LOCALE_DISTRIBUTION}

Messages in this cluster (with locale in brackets):
{$MESSAGES}

Your task is to identify feature(s) this cluster represents, which can explain why users are interested.

Each **feature** can be:
- A topic, subject, concept, or idea
- A type of language, style, tone, or sentiment
- A specific linguistic, rhetorical, or syntactic pattern
- Locale-specific patterns (are different features effective in different locales?)
- Or any other identifiable textual property

Pay attention to whether the locale distribution in this cluster differs from the overall dataset, and whether certain message features might resonate differently with different markets.

Return a list of all identified features that might make a message effective with:
- A description of the feature
- How many messages contain the feature
- The response rate for messages with the feature
- Whether the feature interacts with locale
- A short explanation of why this is interesting
